project: create a 16x16 square grid that dynamically changes with a button adjusting the number of squares per side (1-100). additionaly adding a hover effect that randomly changes the color of the squares within said grid. 

This project mainly focuses on learning DOM interacting with creating divs through javascript and dynamically being able to change the sizing of the grid without changing the number of pixels used. I have learned how to interact with the DOM on a basic level and have further enhanced my knowledge of javascript functionality.
